# Machine Learning for Trading

This repo includes a Python library for structuring cryptocurrency trading data and specifying machine learning trading strategies.

It also includes a tutorial for getting programmers without a trading or finance background oriented on how to build ML driven trading strategies. As a compliment to the tutorial, about 15 months of quite granular trading data from Coinbase, the largest American cryptocurrency exchange, is included for several currencies.

The included assets are as follows:
